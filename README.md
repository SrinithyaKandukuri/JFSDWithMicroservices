# JFSDWithMicroservices
This is Online Book Store Management System using Spring Boot Microservices.
The Online Book Store Management System was developed using a microservices architecture, with a focus on service discovery and load balancing through the integration of an Eureka server. The system is divided into four key modules: APIGateway, AdminMicroservice, CustomerMicroservice, SellerMicroservice, and EurekaMicroservice.

The project employs HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end, Spring Boot for the middleware, and Spring Data JPA for database connectivity, with MySQL/PostgreSQL as the database. In this architecture, the Eureka server facilitates service registration and discovery, ensuring efficient communication between the various microservices.

As the team lead, I was responsible for the development of the CustomerMicroservice module, along with its user interface, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for customers. My work on this module involved creating a robust backend and an efficient UI, making sure that the system was both user-friendly and highly efficient.

This project further enhanced my skills in microservices architecture and full-stack development, preparing me to excel in managing complex, distributed systems.
